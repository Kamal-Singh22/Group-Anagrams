# Group-Anagrams
Write a Java program that takes an array of strings and groups the anagrams together. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.
 Explanation:
We use a HashMap to group anagrams.

Each word is sorted alphabetically, and the sorted version is used as the key.

All words with the same sorted version (anagrams) will be grouped together.

Finally, we return the list of grouped anagrams..........
